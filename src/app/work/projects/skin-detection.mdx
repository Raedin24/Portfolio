## Overview

This project demonstrates **skin detection** using both **HSV** and **YCbCr** color spaces to identify skin-like regions in an image.  
It's implemented in Python with OpenCV and NumPy, combining two color-space masks for more robust results under varying lighting.

---

## Key Features

- Dual color-space filtering (HSV and YCbCr)  
- Morphological cleaning and median filtering  
- Real-time visualization of intermediate and final masks  
- Easily extendable to video-based skin detection

## Technical Approach

The project leverages two different color spaces to create a more accurate skin detection system:

**HSV Color Space**: Effective for segmenting based on hue and saturation, which are less sensitive to lighting variations.

**YCbCr Color Space**: Particularly useful for skin detection as it separates luminance (Y) from color information (Cb, Cr), making it robust to brightness changes.

By combining masks from both color spaces and applying morphological operations, the system achieves better precision in identifying skin regions while reducing false positives.

## Implementation Details

The algorithm follows these key steps:

1. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert input image from BGR to HSV and YCbCr
2. **Thresholding**: Apply range-based masking for skin tones in both color spaces
3. **Morphological Operations**: Use opening operations to remove noise and small artifacts
4. **Mask Fusion**: Combine both masks using bitwise AND operation
5. **Post-processing**: Apply median filtering and additional morphological cleaning
6. **Visualization**: Display intermediate and final results for analysis

## Results

The dual color-space approach significantly improves detection accuracy compared to using either color space alone. The system effectively handles various skin tones and lighting conditions while minimizing false detections from background objects.
