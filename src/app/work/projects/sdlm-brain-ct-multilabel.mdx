# SDLM – Multi‑Label Brain CT Classification

> Undergraduate research implementation investigating how encoding slice‑level dependencies can boost clinical triage signals.

## Overview
Head CT studies are volumetric; single‑slice models miss longitudinal context. SDLM encodes **inter‑slice relationships** to improve detection of multiple findings in a scan.

## Method
- Preprocess DICOMs → windowing, normalization, slice selection
- CNN/Transformer backbone over slices; **temporal/slice attention** aggregates context
- Loss: weighted BCE with focal term; evaluation at both slice and study level

## Dataset & Scale
- ~1,100 scans curated (train/val/test splits); labels consolidated from reports

## Results (illustrative)
- Lift in macro‑AUC vs. slice‑independent baselines
- Better recall on rarer findings after reweighting

## My Contributions
- Implemented data loaders and augmentation pipeline
- Built slice‑attention module and training harness
- Ran ablations on number of slices and aggregation strategies

## Future Work
- Self‑supervised pretraining on unlabeled scans
- Clinical calibration and uncertainty estimates

**Stack:** PyTorch, Python, MONAI (optional), NumPy
